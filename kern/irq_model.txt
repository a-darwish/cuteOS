 *
 * - Interrupt Service Routine (ISR) need not to be re-entrant: the
 *   CPU will _not_ interrupt a handler in execution due to x86's
 *   "interrupt gate" semantics: setting IF=0 upon handler entry.
 *
 * - ISRs need to be thread-safe wrt. other kernel threads accessing
 *   memory areas handled by the ISR.
 *
 * - Functions called by ISRs _must_ be re-entrant. Non-reentrant
 *   parts of such functions should be protected by spin-locks that
 *   automatically disable local interrupts upon getting acquired.
 *
 *   (Code which acquires a spin lock without disabling interrupts
 *   is thread-safe, but not re-entrant.)
 *
 *
 *			@@IRQ_BROADCAST@@
 *
 * - Such ISRs execute concurrently, but not in a re-entrant fashion;
 *   they usually make heavy use of Per-CPU variables in our kernel.
 *
 * - Kernel code should disable interrupts before accessing per-CPU
 *   variables handled by such ISRs, thus avoiding pseudo-concurrent
 *   execution of the per-CPU critical region.
